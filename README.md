# Release Notes

## Final Version  0.5.0
- Dynamic visualization of users' environmental impact, changing based on their responses to questions, now ranges from a barren, dry forest to a thriving, biodiverse forest. This reflects the severity of users' choices and is directly linked to the **Total Carbon Emissions Saved** by the user.
- Update UI design for **Total Carbon Emissions** to seamlessly blend with the overall design.
- Update UI design in **Project** panels.
- Integrated **Project** panels and **Community** visualization in one page to display the history of Hazel community's savings through their projects and users' donations.
- Update UI design in **Suggestions** with images for each recommendation, showing the amount users can donate to Hazel to offset the carbon emissions they generate.

### Bug Fixes
- Main Visualization was not able to read *Total Carbon Emissions*.
- **Community** Panel overflows.

## Version 0.4.0

### Features
- Visualization for users effect on the environment are now viewable depending on their responses to lifestyle questions.
- Main visualization ranges from poor, dry forest to flourishing, biologically diverse forest to show users the severity of their choices. 
- Users' "Total Carbon Emissions" calculation reported in lbs instead of tons to make it easier to understand.

### Bug Fixes
- Climate visualization appears to the right of questions for each tab and remains consistent across all tabs. 

### Known Issues
- Community page has inconsistent formatting and visualization does not load. 
- Final visualization for each tab does not update dynamically in relation to user's clicks.

## Version 0.3.0

### Features
- Created numerical representations for **Air Travel**, **Car Usage**, **Electricity**, **Lifestyle**, and **Housing** with new styling.
- Numerical representations are now independent of each other and are styled to individual tabs.
- Created the projects tab to show current Hazel projects that can be donated to.

### Bug Fixes
- Landing page gradient previously did not encompass the entire page. Fixed this so that the landing page has a consistent background.

### Known Issues
- Projects tab causes background to change near the bottom of the screen; gradient does not fill screen
- Carbon total states are not saved when coming back from Community page to the Main Panel page.

## Version 0.2.0
### Features
- Modified a landing page design. The landing page is an introductory page of the application that will hook the user in and briefly explain how to use it.
- Created **Air Travel**, **Electricity**, **Lifestyle**, and **Housing** panel based on a template design. 
  - In each category, the panel includes questions and input and calculates the total carbon emission based on user input.
- **[Toggle Button](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-toggle-button/)** design was updated to match the overall design template for better visual consistency. **[Toggle Button](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-toggle-button/)** is used for user input.
  - Font (changed to **Tahoma** for readability)
  - FontWeight (changed to **bold** for readability)
  - Color (changed color of **Selected** button and **Hover** effect)
### Bug Fixes
- Fixed that **[Toggle Button Group](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-toggle-button/)** allowed the multiple selection.

## Version 0.1.0
### Features
- Created a landing page for the application.  The landing page is an introductory page of the application that will hook the user in and briefly explain how to use it.
- Created a template under **Car Usage** for the category page, to be implemented for each category. The purpose of this feature is to prepare our application to take in different types of user input.
  - Included Input fields for users lifestlye choices.
    1. Ideally, what type of car would you drive?
        - Gas-powered car
        - Hybrid car (Half gas, half electric)
        - Electric-powered car
    2. How much less do you want to drive? 
        - Â¼ less
        - 1/2  less
        - 3/4 less
        - Maintain driving time
    3. If you were to try to take public transportation to reduce carbon emissions, what would you take?
        - The bus
        - The train/subway
        - Light Rail
        - Streetcar/Trolley
  - Each option uses **[Toggle Button](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-toggle-button/)**, with **[Exclusive Selection](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-toggle-button/#exclusive-selection)** for each question.
- Created functions that are able to read the data from user for future backend tasks. This is an important component in the communication between frontend and backend.
  
  ```javascript
    const carTypeChange = (event, nextView) => {
        // Detect selection changes 
        setCarType(nextView);
        // TODO: Send the changed value to the server
    };
    // ..
  ```
  
- Changed the size of the **Main Panel** for future comprehensive dynamic visualization on the right side. 
  - From a relative size, **92%**, to a fixed size, **550px**, to prevent the content from being hidden.
